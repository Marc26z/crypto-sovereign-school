# crypto-sovereign-school
I am making a bitcoin education course designed to teach people how to use bitcoin to opt-out of the fiat system.

**Purpose:**
I looked at the bitcoin courses on Udemy and saw hundreds of courses that teach people how to "trade crypto," invest in crypto, or learn blockchain whatever. There is a couple bitcoin only courses, but I want to go deeper down the rabbit hole.





This course is published under the CC0-1.0 licenselicence. [To support my work, please zap sats to me here](https://nostree.me/npub1marc26z8nh3xkj5rcx7ufkatvx6ueqhp5vfw9v5teq26z254renshtf3g0/) 
Thank you for you for support.
